# Spell fragment card data

# Text -> ASCII Art: http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Rectangles&t=Monster

# Data Format:
#   spell_card_data:
#     List of <pattern-info>
#
#   <pattern-info>:
#     <pattern>, List of <card>s that use pattern
#
#   <card>:
#     <title>, <attributes>, List of <description> strings
#
#   <attribute>:
#     'element'

# Spell patterns are normalized:
#  * If spell has '@', then it should be in upper-left corner
#    * If not possible, then in top row as close as possible to upper-left corner
#      * If multiple options, then choose option with '.' in upper-left
#  * Else 'X' in upper-left corner. 
#  * Prefer wider spells over taller spells.
