# Casting Spells

There are 3 stages to casting a spell:

## Construct Base Tapestry

Place TAPESTRY cards in front of you to build a
TAPESTRY.

## Add Threads

When you place mana from your MANA POOL onto your
TAPESTRY it becomes a THREAD that can activate a
magic spell fragment.

## Cleanup

You do not need to completely remove all THREADs before
casting a new spell.
