# Spell cards

A spell card contains the following information:

* Name.
* Pattern.
* Effect.
* (Optional) Flavor text.

## Name

An evocative title for the spell.

## Pattern

This is the representation of the layout that must be created in the mage's tapestry
in order to cast this spell.

The Pattern may or may not contain an ELEMENT.

Spells that do not contain an ELEMENT are NEUTRAL.

## Effect

Spell effects have three parts:

1. An effect that occurs at the time the spell is cast.
2. A permanent effect for when the spell has one or more charges on it.
3. A reactionary effect that requires a charge on the spell and costs something (often a charge) to use.

## Design space expansions for Spells

* Multiple elements in pattern
* Constraints within the squares of the pattern

# Element properties

In general, if an element is good at one aspect, the opposing element is bad at the same.

## Fire
active, light (weight), bright, thin, movement, transformation, change, destruction, hot

* Enemy: Water (tendril control)
* Primary Ability: Damage
* Secondary Ability: Movement (Air)
* Tertiary Ability: Shield (Earth)
* Primary Hate: Tendril Control
* Tendrils: one quick consumed

Fire likes blast damage, cheap but difficult-to-control bursts at single targets that are consumed by the spell. Fire doesn't like charges, because they're too slow -- Fire wants its effects now. Fire isn't good at manipulating tendrils, as it's too much work. Good fire play needs tendril support from another color.

Fire hates other tendrils, and has the best tendril-killing spells around.

For patterns, fire likes diagonals and distance; many fire spells need multiple cards (but only one or two mana).

## Air
active, light (weight), bright, thin, movement, travel, flying, finding, teaching, imagination, sound

* Enemy: Earth (shields)
* Primary Ability: Movement
* Secondary Ability: Tendril Control (Water)
* Tertiary Ability: Damage (Fire)
* Tendrils: one quick permanent

Air likes precision effects to single targets, and quick, flowing movement. Swapping positions with a tendril, for example. Air likes permanent charges, where you have an ability for as long as you hold the charge. Air is great at quickly moving a single tendril around -- warping it to another forest, or quickly through the plains. Air is terrible at protection and reactions, so hopefully your motion can keep you safe or you can branch into another color for a shield.

Air hates shield and protection effects, and has lots of ways to blow away charges and move your opponents' tendrils away from their positions.

For patterns, air likes close diagonals; an air symbol with lots of space around it can cast and combo a bunch of spells by itself.

## Water
passive, heavy, dark, thick, flowing, living, cleansing, psychic, scrying/mirrors, dreams, cool

* Enemy: Fire (damage)
* Primary Ability: Tendril Control
* Secondary Ability: Shield (Earth)
* Tertiary Ability: Movement (Air)
* Tendrils: many slow consumed

Water likes sending a wave of tendrils out to break upon its opponents. Move all your tendrils two MPs, then consume tendrils to move co-located mages two MPs, for example. Water likes spending its tendrils as charges, instead of holding charges on spells. It's great at moving a bunch of tendrils around, pulling strings all over the map. Water has a tough time doing damage -- best it can do is warp you back up to the astral plane or push you around. If you want to kill someone, branch into another color.

Water hates damage effects, and has lots of ways to redirect it or punish your opponent for using it. (If a water mage is going down, you're going down with them.)

For patterns, water likes connections; orthogonal or diagonal doesn't matter to water, as long as the spell leaves a stream of thread on your tapestry.

## Earth
passive, heavy, dark, thick, stability, quiet, birth, fertility, strength, cool, solid

* Enemy: Air (movement)
* Primary Ability: Shield
* Secondary Ability: Damage (Fire)
* Tertiary Ability: Tendril Control (Water)
* Tendrils: many slow permanent

Earth plays a low-mana game. Lots of charges and very slow-moving tendrils give it powerful static map control, but very little mana left over to actually _change_ the game state. Opponents have to take time eating through the earth mage's tendrils and charges in order to actually affect them -- charged shields and tendril volcanos are powerful weapons if you can get another element to help you manipulate them.

Earth hates movement effects, and has lots of ways to lock you down in your space or punish you after moving.

For patterns, earth avoids diagonals; blocky L shapes (no knight moves, even) make earth happy.

## Neutral

Neutral spells are just straight worse than others, almost always requiring an extra mana for the same (or even a worse) effect. On the other hand, they have no symbol requirement, and no particular ability weakness. A three-mana neutral spell might do damage, or give you a bunch of movement, or whatever.

For patterns, neutral takes on the desire of the elements its copying. (The primary one-mana neutral spell without a pattern just drops a tendril in your current location.)

## Elemental Pairs

- Fire / Air is a quick-moving mage that shoots fireballs, but they're a glass cannon that has to re-target with each attack.
- Air / Water is a flexible, hard-to-predict mage that can send out a bunch of chaff to hide their intentions, but they're poor at reacting quickly.
- Water / Earth is a slow-moving "tower mage" that might only cast one actual spell a turn, but affects the whole map with their permanent-power, wave-like tendrils.
- Earth / Fire is a tank with a flamethrower, prepared to deal with nearby threats but unable to affect the distant map.
