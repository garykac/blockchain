# Spell Charges

Some spells have charges which allow them to enable an effect that the mage can choose to enable at some later time.

A charge is recorded by taking a Spell Marker and placing it on the spell card.

Unless otherwise specified, charges can be spent at any time (even during another player's turn). A common use for charges is to be able to react to actions that an opponent (attacking, pushing, et al.)

A mage can choose to abandon a charge and recover the Spell Marker at any time during their turn.
