# Woven

A tabletop game of tactical magecraft.

## Components

Common:

* 1 map with terrain
* [33 double-sided Tapestry cards](tapestry-cards-2sided.md)
* 36 Spell Fragment cards

Per-player/color:

* 1 Mage token
* 11 Mana counters

## Setup

### General

* Map in center of table
* Tapestry cards: Shuffle and place next to map
* Spell cards: Remove all starter spells, shuffle, place next to map

### For each player

* Choose a color
* Place Mage on map
* Take 4 starting spells
* Draw a random Tapestry card and choose a side to start Tapestry

### To start game

* Choose starting player
* Draw 4 spells from deck and create a Market

## Each turn

Choose one of the following Actions:

* Play a card to **Cast a Spell**
* Discard a card for its **Minor Effect**
* **Re-cast** an Active Spell
* **Recover**

At any time during your turn, you may Abandon an Eye or Charge and immediately add
the token back in your Mana Pool.

### Cast a Spell

To cast a spell:

* Place the spell card in the Active Spell area
* Add Threads to your Tapestry to complete the spell pattern
    * To add a thread, take mana from your pool and place it on an empty Tapestry square
    * You must add at least 1 Thread to cast a spell

If you cannot complete with pattern, then you may not cast the spell.

If adding a Thread completes multiple spell patterns, then you must choose only 1.

You may cast this spell as many times as you wish
as long as you complete a new pattern in your tapestry for each cast.

### Minor Effect

Place the card in your discard pile to use the Minor Effect

There are 4 Minor Effects:

* Draw a new Tapestry card and add it to your Tapestry
* Create a new Eye by taking Mana from your Pool and placing it on the map at your Mage's location
* Move your Mage 2 spaces
* Recover a Thread from your Tapestry (back into your Mana Pool)

You may play multiple copies of the same Minor Effect on your turn to combine the effect.

### Re-cast a Spell

Any spell in the Active Spell area may be recast if you add mana
to your Tapestry to match the pattern.

### Recover

To Recover, perform the following steps:

* Remove a spell from the Market:
    * If you have control of enough Stars and want to acquire a spell, then
        * Mark the Stars on the map with Depletion Tokens so the Stars cannot be used again
        * Take the spell and add it to your Discard pile
    * Otherwise, discard the lowest spell in the Market
* Refresh the Market
    * Slide spells down
    * Draw new spell and add to top of market
* Discard all spells from the Active Spell area that don't have a Charge
* Draw hand back up to 4 cards



## Spells

### Casting Spells

The act of casting a spell is a multi-step process.

First, you must create your Tapestry and ensure that it is arranged so that the spell
pattern can be created.

Then you must play the spell card and add Threads to the Tapestry to complete the pattern.

### Spell Patterns

The pattern shown on the spell card is the canonical form for the pattern, but when casting
you can create that pattern in any mirrored or rotated state.

### Active Spells

A spell is Active after you've cast it, but before you've cleaned up during Recover.

Spells that are Active can be cast again.

### Charges

Some spells accept a Charge when they are cast. This Charge can either maintain an ongoing effect
or it can be Spent for a one-time spell effect.


## Mage Combat

When you attack a location, you attack everything in that location, and that includes any Mages
that happen to be there.

While you were at the Acadamie, they of course taught you that it was wildly inappropriate
for one Mage to attack another. But they also taught a history of Great Mages throughout Time,
many of whom carried with them a healthy disregard for the safety and well-being of others.
Attacking another creature (Mage or otherwise) while at the Acadamie would lead to swift punishment.

But you're not at the *Acadamie* anymore.

In the real world, there are no rules other than the ones you bring within you. And it is in this
real world that you discover the kind of Mage that you really are.


### Attack

### Defense
