# Targeting

Targeting is a requirement for many spells. When a mage sets a target, a target marker is placed on that location. Note that targets are associated with a location, not with a creature.

By default, a mage can manage up to 2 independent targets.

## Default Target

By default, all targets are set to the Astral plane, but the mage can, at any time during their turn, set a target to the
mage's current location.

Unless stated otherwise, spells have no effect when targeting the Astral plane.

## Setting a Target

When a target is set (e.g., using the Target spell), a marker is placed at that location. The target stays at that location even if the mage moves away.

## Resetting Targets

When target is canceled or dispelled, the target is reset. This places the target back to the Astral plane.

At any time during their turn, a mage may choose to reset any target they currently have.

When a mage is killed, all of their targets are reset (except the Home target, see below).

## Home Target

The mage always has an implicit target at their home location. This target is not lost when the mage dies and can be used to return back to the living world after their body has be destroyed.
