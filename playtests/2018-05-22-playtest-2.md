# Playtest #2

Tue 22 May 2018

Participants: self, AdamB, SverreR, JeffB JoshO'M

## Components

* Small hex board
* 70 matrix cards
* 100 spell cards (25 spells with variants for each of the 4 Elements)

## Rules

Each turn, do one of the following:

* Draw matrix card, place onto matrix.
	Collect dice equal to the number of boxes covered by the newly placed card.
* Place dice onto squares on matrix. Each die must be orthogonally adjacent to
	the previous die placed. You may place as many dice as possible this way.
* Cast spell. Dice must be in place in your matrix and match a spell in the set
	of available spells or one that you already have.

## Comments

Initial layout of 5 available cards had 2 duplicated spells. This didn't feel good
for player choice.

Need short simple spells - spells were too complex. This was partially due to a mistake
where I forgot to account for the Element on the spell so there (Effectively) were no
3-block spells, only 2-, 4- and 5-block spells

## Suggestions/Actions

Consider three rows of available spells: simple medium complex
Need lots of movement spells (25%-40%)
The spells should be simple and focus on a single attribute: strength, defense, move, create x

Change spellcasting so that spells are built quickly but take time to tear down. This 
feels better for a first-time player experience and fits with the theme as the 
exhausted mage needs time to recover.
