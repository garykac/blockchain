Initial proposal - Mon 7 May 2018

* Cards have a 2x3 set of squares (like Innovation or Honshu)
* Cards are played by overlapping (covering at least one square on an existing card)
* Each square on each cards is effectively a piece of micro code in a spell casting language.
* Some of the squares on the cards are connected to neighbors, but not all of them
* Once enough cards are laid out, the spell can be cast
* Dice are rolled (one per card played for the spell) and the player can start activating the spell over many turns
* Longer spells takes longer to set up (obviously) but can be safer to cast or more powerful.
* So there is no "fireball" spell, but you can build one up from the basic micro code instructions
* Spell casting can fail if you:
	* Don't have the right dice or enough dice
	* Are interrupted during the cast
	* Voluntarily abandon the spell (presumably to avoid more damage from failure)
* Dice must be placed on the squares on the cards as part of spell activation
* The squares and connections have restrictions that must be met for the die to be valid
