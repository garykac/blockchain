# Playtest #1

Wed 16 May 2018

Participants: self, AdamB, SverreR, JeffB

## Components

* Small hex board
* x matrix cards
* 8 spell cards (patterns only, no spells)

## Rules

Each turn, do one of the following:

* Draw matrix card, place onto matrix.
	Collect dice equal to the number of boxes covered by the newly placed card.
* Place dice onto squares on matrix. Each die must be orthogonally adjacent to
	the previous die placed. You may place as many dice as possible this way.
* Cast spell. Dice must be in place in your matrix and match a spell in the set
	of available spells or one that you already have.

## Comments

Focused on testing the matrix cards.

No spells, so people made up "reasonable" spells once they initially cast the
spell pattern.

Patterns on the sample spells were easy since they involved a small number of squares
and didn't have any constraints.

## Actions

Add Element contraints to the blank spaces on the Matrix cards. Add these Elements
to the spells so that it is clear that these need to be matched.
