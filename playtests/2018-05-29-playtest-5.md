## Components

* [22x19 hex board](../img/playtest_5_map.jpg)
* 66 (single-sided) matrix cards
* Token for each player
* 2 Tokens/player to mark target
* 10 Mana cubes

## Setup

* Deck of single-sided matrix cards with top 4 revealed
* All basic spell cards in shared area
* 2 rows (4 each) of simple and advanced spells

## Rules

Each turn, do each of the following:

* Remove a spell die from Matrix (if possible)
* Spend up to 3 Action Points (APs)

### Action Points

* 1 AP - move 2 spaces along road
* 1 AP - move 1 space into field
* 2 AP - move 1 space into forest
* 3 AP - move 1 space into mountain
* 2 AP - draw matrix card and add to matrix
* 1 AP - take 1 cubes and cast a spell
* 2 AP - take 2 cubes and cast spells
* 3 AP - take 6 cubes and cast spells

### Drawing and Adding to Matrix

Choose one of the available Matrix cards and add to
Matrix. And dice that are covered by the new card
are removed from the Matrix and added back into
your pool.

### Casting Spells

Take the specified number of dice from your pool and add them one at
a time to the Matrix.

After each die is placed, if that die completes a
spell fragment pattern, then that spell fragment
is cast and its effect happens immediately.

If multiple spell patterns are matched, the player
must choose one.

### Damage

Mages die when they take a single point of damage. They are sent to the Astral plane and must teleport back to the world. All targets, spell markers and charges are lost.

## Comments

Should there be a limit on the number of spells that mages can have at a time?

"Mountain Walk" - can't move into mountain with this spell, so you have to spend 3AP before you can use it. Would rather be able to tunnel through mountains.

Cannot move targets while in the astral plane
Summon Minions

* charges = number of spaces
* Air Minion can only move through Plains
* Others can move through element + Plains

For "Capture the Flag" game, you cannot move the flag through the astral plane.

Levitate until start of next turn. If over bad terrain, you must move off spot immediately.

Change Protection cost to be 1-1 (since you now have to spend one of the limited mana charges)

Use same token for target and mana

[A] Allow more than 2 targets at a time

Targets are like an army of minions that the mage sends forth.

[GN] Spell - Fire wall to block off an area

[A] Spell - Fire spell that hits multiple targets

Charges to block someone

Private prison - player locked in prison until they do sufficient damage to it.

Fireball to multiple spaces around target, but you lose the target

Lightning charge up and then fire them at multiple targets. Then remove target

[A] Obfuscate could be done without board markers by having charges. Spend them to move targets away when they get close to your targets

[A] Terraform Plainss - too weak

How to terraform Rivers

[A] Drafting cards at the start. For example:

* N piles of cards
	* Face down
	* Each initially with 1 card
* Takes turns choosing a pile
	* Look at cards on first pile, if you want it, take it
	* Otherwise, add a card to that pile and go to the next pile
* At some point, the "bad" piles will get better with the additional cards.

[GN] Wildcard element spot in spell to select the element of the spell. E.g,, the element for terraform

[A] Stand on location to get VP (like control). "King of the Mountain"

[J] Get free stuff at certain locations: spells, matrix cards, ...

Jeff:

* NEG - spell selection (discussed earlier)
* POS - like new spells that move target faster. Previously this was too slow.
* POS teleport with 2 parts

Greg:

* NEG - need another way for matrix cards to erase
	* Spend turn to remove all mana
	* Matrix cards are too expensive later. Perhaps the first 3 cost 2, then after that they cost 1
* NEG - didn't like target lagging behind on the board
	* Want to be able to control people more
	* Zoning map. want more player move
* POS - Matrix
* POS - Protection spells. Charging shield
* Would like to be able to play as other than a wizard (eg: a dragon)

Adam:

* NEG - element spells are too specific
	* Didn't have to commit in matrix to a particular element
	* Element in matrix should not be tied to earth elements
	* For multiple spells that are the same, use different patterns
* POS - Like idea of using same token for targets and mana

[A] Charges to make target location into a particular terrain type while the target remains there.

[A] Moving a target allows you to move all targets

Spells that can hit all targets simultaneously. Fireball.

Terraform - not enough in game cares about this.

Game is effectively mana worker placement

Changes to the map can be thought of as temporary enchantments

[GN] Make elements feel different. Air for move, ...

[A] Action points. Can they be removed? Spend mana tokens to draw card?

Haste could: move 3 plains, 2 forest, 1 mountain

Resting turns to instantly recover all cubes. Conflicts with using cubes in matrix as a recovery cost when casting spells.

* Possibly recover set number (3)

Have spells that are better if you have more targets.

No reason not to allow mirroring the spells patterns (less confusing).

## Suggestions/Actions

For next playtest:

* Try getting rid of Action Points
* Use only Mana tokens for Matrix, Charges and Targets
* Try using only 1 component (mana) for entire game
	* Use more charges on spells
* Don't try to link spell mana and terrain types.
* Allow spell patterns to be mirrored
